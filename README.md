This was my tutorial to program my first synthesizer plug-in in the JUCE framework. It was done under the
instruction of Matthijs Hollemans' book "Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE". It's a great
masterpiece which gives a step-by-step introduction utilizing the JUCE framework. Additionally, it explains
in a comprehensible manner the connections and the structure of a synthesizer. By using multiple figural examples
he manages to explain complicated algorithms and code snippets in an easy fashion. Altogether, I was really
impressed and it helped me to get a better understanding of a structure of a synthesizer and how to set up
own plug-ins in future. For further details about the JX11 synthesizer visit Matthijs Hollemans (hollance)
page on GitHub.

I added a plain customized GUI to the JX11 plug-in with rotary knob, buttons and a combo box. The original
version by hollance uses a generic editor by the software. It's a homework for the reader to create customized
GUI.
